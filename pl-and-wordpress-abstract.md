# Using a Pattern Library with WordPress

When working with WordPress, it’s common for frontend code to live within your theme; often mixing presentation with logic. Pattern Libraries help with this separation and allow you to build a backend-agnostic design system. In practice keeping the two in sync is fiddly & time consuming that makes future iteration difficult. As soon as they fall out of sync, the cons start to outweigh the pros.

This talk will show you how to maintain a clear separation between your front-end & WordPress code, without any of the integration headaches. It will also cover pattern library best practices, how to integrate a pattern library with WordPress and how embracing both can be empowering.

## Notes

Let’s face it, WordPress can be a poisoned chalice: "Something that seems very good when it is first received, but in fact does great harm to the person who receives it."

- Background (emphasize “problem” or “gap” in previous research)
- Aim or objective of study you are presenting (linking this with background)
- Participants/methods (only what we absolutely need to know)
- Predictions and actual results (in line with or contrary to your expectations?)
- Conclusions / importance of this work (contributions to the field, novelty)
